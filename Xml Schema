An XML Schema describes the structure of an XML document, just like a DTD.

An XML document with correct syntax is called "Well Formed".

An XML document validated against an XML Schema is both "Well Formed" and "Valid".

<xs:element name="note">

<xs:complexType>
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name="to" type="xs:string"/>
    <xs:element name="from" type="xs:string"/>
    <xs:element name="heading" type="xs:string"/>
    <xs:element name="body" type="xs:string"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>

</xs:element>

The Schema above is interpreted like this:
<xs:element name="note"> defines the element called "note"
<xs:complexType> the "note" element is a complex type
<xs:sequence> the complex type is a sequence of elements
<xs:element name="to" type="xs:string"> the element "to" is of type string (text)
<xs:element name="from" type="xs:string"> the element "from" is of type string
<xs:element name="heading" type="xs:string"> the element "heading" is of type string
<xs:element name="body" type="xs:string"> the element "body" is of type string

With XML Schema, your XML files can carry a description of its own format.

With XML Schema, independent groups of people can agree on a standard for interchanging data.

With XML Schema, you can verify data.


Another great strength about XML Schemas is that they are written in XML:

You don't have to learn a new language
You can use your XML editor to edit your Schema files
You can use your XML parser to parse your Schema files
You can manipulate your Schemas with the XML DOM
You can transform your Schemas with XSLT
